> Automate your browser testing now! ðŸ¤–

Robrowser is a bot to help you test your project in many different browsers and operating systems.

It started as a automation for [Browser Stack](https://www.browserstack.com) and its goal is to help you validate how your project look in many different environments by taking screenshots for you.

[Saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com/) is also currently accepted and if you would like to see other cross-browser tester running open an issue or a pull-request so we can check it!

## Usage

Robrowser will look for a `.robrowser` config file in the folder you're executing it to check for your credentials (currently we just support Browser Stack).

With the config file having tests to be executed, Robrowser will run them for you and create a `./screenshot` folder with the results, this way you will be able to see if your frontend projects are rendering as expected.

Check our [example config file](./.robrowser) to see other available keys.

**Disclaimer: this project isn't available on `npm` yet, check the Local usage section for now**

### Global installation

```sh
npm i -g robrowser
# or
yarn global add robrowser
```

### One-time usage with npx

If you have `npm@5.2.0` installed you can use [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) to execute commands without needing to install a global package if you don't want to.

To do so just run

```sh
npx robrowser
```

Clone this project

```sh
git clone git clone git@github.com:pagarme/robrowser.git
