> Automate your browser testing now! ðŸ¤–

Robrowser is a bot to help you test your project in many different browsers and operating systems.

## Support

The currently supported tests are:

- [Browser Stack](https://www.browserstack.com)

The next hubs we intend to support are:

- [Saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com/)

If you want some other hub just create an [issue](https://github.com/pagarme/robrowser/issues)!

## Usage

### Local usage

Using `yarn` or `npm`

```sh
yarn add robrowser --dev
```

Add in your `package.json`

Run it
```sh
"scripts": {
  "robrowser": "robrowser start"
}
```

Now just run the command
```
yarn robrowser
```

Remember, to run you need to configure the `.robrowser` file at the root of the project.

### Global installation

```sh
npm i -g robrowser
# or
yarn global add robrowser
```

### One-time usage with npx

If you have `npm@>5.2.0` installed you can use [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) to execute commands without needing to install a global package if you don't want to.

To do so just run

```sh
npx robrowser
```

## Configuration

Robrowser will look for a `.robrowser` config file in the folder you're executing it to check for your credentials (currently we just support Browser Stack).

Some of `.robrowser` configuration parameters.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `remote` | *object* | Configure the connection and access credentials.
| `screenshot` | *object* | Configuration related to screenshot.
| `browsers` | *array* | List counting the tests that will be performed, let's call it browser.
| `concurrency` | *number* | Number of tests running in parallel.

the `currency` parameter is very important, the hubs have a limited number of parallel tests, if you work as a team this will help you to run your tests without problems.

### The `remote` attribute.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `host` | *string* | Host dos testes, ex: `hub.browserstack.com`.
| `port` | *number* | Port you want to use for tests, defaut is 80.
| `user` | *string* | If you are using a hub, here is your user.
| `pwd` | *string* | If you are using a hub, here is your password.

### The `screenshot` attribute.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `folder` | *string* | Define the directory where the screenshots will be saved. Default is `./screenshots`

### The `browser` parameter

> Each browser represents a test, for each test you can set capabilities of each respective browser you want to test.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `os` | *string* | OS you want to test.
| `os_version` | *string* | OS version you want to test.
| `browserName` | *string* | Browser you want to test.
| `browser_version` | *string* | Browser version you want to test.
| `resolution` | *string* | Set the resolution of VM before beginning of your test.
| `url` | *string* | Url of the page you want to test.
| `test` | *string* | Path of test.
| `local` | *boolean* | Access a url from your local network.

Check our [example config file](./examples/.robrowser) to see all available keys.

## What is a _test_?

Test are nothing more than functions that will receive a browser to run and a callback for the next test, [example test file](./examples/index.des.js).

For more commands just look at this [documentation](https://github.com/admc/wd/blob/master/doc/api.md).

With the config file having tests to be executed, Robrowser will run them for you and create a `./screenshot` folder with the results, this way you will be able to see if your frontend projects are rendering as expected.

## Testing and linting

We use [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) to run tests under the `./tests/` folder, you can execute it with:

```sh
yarn test
# or
npm test
```

Our [lint file](.eslintrc) extends [Pagar.me's JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/pagarme/javascript-style-guide) and you can execute it with:

```sh
yarn lint
# or
npm run lint
```
